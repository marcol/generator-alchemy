/**
 * BASE RULES
 * 
 * A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, 
 * a descendent selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. 
 * It doesnâ€™t include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default 
 * styling for how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.
