/**
 * LAYOUT RULES
 * 
 * CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page. 
 * However, there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major 
 * and minor components of a page. The minor components—such as a callout, 
 * or login form, or a navigation item—sit within the scope of major 
 * components such as a header or footer. I refer to the minor components 
 * as Modules and will dive into those in the next section. 
 * The major components are referred to as Layout styles.
 *
 * Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based 
 * on reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are 
 * traditionally styled using ID selectors but take the time to think 
 * about the elements that are common across all components of the page 
 * and use class selectors where appropriate.
