/**
 * THEME RULES
 *
 * It is probably self-evident but a theme defines colours and 
 * images that give your application or site its look and feel. 
 * Separating the theme out into its own set of styles allows 
 * for those styles to be easily redefined for alternate themes.
 *
 * Themes can affect any of the primary types. It could override 
 * base styles like default link colours. It could change module 
 * elements such as chrome colours and borders. It could affect 
 * layout with different arrangements. It could also alter how 
 * states look.
 *
 * Letâ€™s say you have a dialog module that needs to have a 
 * border colour of blue, the border itself would be initially 
 * defined in the module and then the theme defines the colour
