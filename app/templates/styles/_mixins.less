/**
 * DEFINING LESS MIXINS
 *
 * Mixins allow you to embed all the properties of a class 
 * into another class by simply including the class name 
 * as one of its properties. Itâ€™s just like variables, 
 * but for whole classes. Mixins can also behave like functions, 
 * and take arguments, as seen in the example below.
